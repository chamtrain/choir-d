    <h1>CHOIR API Documentation</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The CHOIR API is designed to provide both access to CHOIR data as well as integration points within the CHOIR clinic application. The data exchange portion of the API and the integration interfaces can be used separately or in concert.</p>
    <h2>Data exchange</h2>
    <p>The data exchange portion of the CHOIR API is comprised of RESTful services that read and/or return JSON objects.</p>
    <p>Version 1.0 of the API will support GET requests for “Patient”, “PatientAttribute”, “PatientReport”, “Survey” and “Assessment” resources. <p>See the <a href="./restlet-api/index.html">Restlet API</a> documentation for details</p>
    <p>The API uses the same security mechanisms as the application. Version 1.0 of the API requires the “<strong>Schedule, Patient & Report tabs</strong>” (ROLE_CLINIC_STAFF) permission.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>CHOIR interface integration points:</h2>
    <p>Integration points within the application provide a way to include custom data generated by HTML within the CHOIR interface.</p>
    <p>Using JavaScript or a JavaScript framework like AngularJS or React custom html can retrieve and display CHOIR data through the data API and optionally combine it with external static and dynamic content.</p><p>See the <a href="./interface-api/index.html">Interface API</a> documentation for details.</p>
