Hello. We would very munch like you to answer some questions about yourself and take an online survey by  [SURVEY_DATE].  You can do this by clicking on the following link:
[SURVEY_LINK] 

If you have any questions or have any troubles accessing the questionnaire via the link please give us a call at 1-555-1212.
If you are not able to complete the online questionnaire prior to  [SURVEY_DATE] then please arrive 1 hour early when you visit in person in order to ensure you have enough time to
complete the questionnaire at the clinic before your scheduled appointment.

Thank you,
The Stanford Pain Management Center
