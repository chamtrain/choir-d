  <h3>Courage to Act with Pain: Teens Identifying Values, Acceptance, and Treatment Effects (CAPTIVATE)</h3>
  <p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
  You are invited to participate in a research study of the impact of a pediatric pain support group for 
  teens and their parents on functioning, pain, and quality of life. The Pediatric Pain Management Clinic 
  will provide group therapy to adolescents 12 to 18 years old and their parents/caregivers. The CAPTIVATE 
  program – “Courage to Act with Pain: Teens Identifying Values, Acceptance, and Treatment Effects” – will 
  meet for 8 group sessions over the course of 10 weeks. The 2 additional weeks will be for an individual 
  session & wrap-up meeting. The teen group will focus on 1) developing coping skills to help manage discomfort, 
  and 2) increasing functioning in valued life areas. The parent/caregiver group will include pain-related 
  education and management strategies, skill development (i.e., skills taught to youth will also be shared 
  with parents), and how to support valued functional domains (e.g., academics, friendships, athletics) for 
  your child.
  </p>
  <p>In addition, you and your child will be asked to complete secure online questionnaires before the start 
  of the group. If you did not have a chance to complete them before start of group, you will use a 
  Stanford-encrypted iPad to complete the questionnaires now. The questionnaires focus on demographics, 
  medical history, and functioning (e.g., sleep, school, activity), as well as thoughts, feelings, and 
  behaviors related to the experience of pain for your child and family (e.g., stress, sadness, and other 
  pain concerns); however, at any time, you have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. If you 
  agree to participate in the study after learning more from our research team (e.g., examples of questions, 
  frequency of questionnaires, how the study happens online, how to stop participation if wanted at any time 
  for any reason), you will be asked similar questions via email at the middle and end of the treatment group 
  as well as at three months after you and your child’s graduation from CAPTIVATE.
  </p>
  <p><b>STUDY PURPOSE:</b>
  Improve emotional, behavioral, and general functioning in youth with discomfort. We also anticipate that the 
  parallel caregiver group will empower parents to feel more comfortable with and confident in their approach 
  to helping their teen with chronic pain. Finally, your participation will help us to determine how helpful 
  pediatric pain group therapy can be – and which elements are most useful – based on 1) information that you 
  will share before, during and after the completion of the treatment and 2) your feedback at the end of the program.
  </p>
  <p>Specifically, the program will involve two treatments that research indicates are helpful for pain management:
  1) Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and 2) Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT). We hope that discussions with 
  peers, skills practice, homework assignments, and family sessions will improve outcomes related to emotions 
  (e.g., sadness & anxiety), behavioral control over discomfort (e.g., coping skills), and functioning in activities 
  (e.g., sports, socialization, academics) most important to your child. Ultimately, we believe that your involvement, 
  insight, and feedback will help us to improve what and how we use these treatments in pediatric pain management.
  </p>
  <p><b>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</b></p>
  <p><u>Risks</u>: Questionnaires and therapy sessions might increase your family’s awareness of how pain has affected 
  your lives, but we do not expect discomfort. Group discussions are, by nature, less private than individual therapy. 
  Seeing other teens or parents may also increase awareness of how you manage pain. 
  </p>
  <p><u>Benefits</u>: We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study; 
  however, you and/or your child may develop skills to help your family feel more in control of discomfort vs. pain 
  controlling your lives. Your family may experience positive feelings due to: identifying, learning from, and giving 
  support to other families managing chronic pain. Some families may also enjoy research involvement that may help 
  to advance pediatric pain treatments. 
  </p>
  <p><b>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</b></p>
  <ol>
  <li>Your family’s total time involvement if you agree to participate will be 10 weeks. 
  <li>CAPTIVATE program meetings will occur once per week for 90 minutes over the course of 8 sessions. One individual 
  meeting with your child (50 – 60 min) will occur after 4 group sessions, and one 60-minute graduation/final meeting will 
  occur at the end of the program. The anticipated schedule for the 8 group sessions:
  <ul>
  <li>4 – 4:50 p.m.  Teen Group with Dr. Huestis / Caregiver Group with postdoc</li>
  <li>4:50 – 5 p.m.  Break</li>
  <li>5 – 5:30 p.m.  Family Discussion</li>
  </ul>
  <li>You will also be asked to complete questionnaires at three times:</li>
  <ol>
  <li>The first set will be completed online and take approximately 30 – 45 minutes for parents, and 20 – 30 minutes for youth.</li>
  <li>The second set will consist of short questionnaires (5 – 10 min) completed halfway through the CAPTIVATE 10-week program.</li>
  <li>The final set will consist of questionnaires similar to the first set, and take approximately 30 minutes for parents and 20 – 30 minutes for youth.</li>
  <li>You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>You and your child will also be asked to complete abbreviated follow-up questionnaires at 3 months following the completion 
  of the group to assess progress.
  </ol>
  <p><b>PAYMENTS:</b>
  There is no monetary reimbursement for participation in this study, but families will be billed for outpatient treatment as they 
  are for all mental health services in the Pain Clinic.
  </p>
  <p><b>PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS:</b>
  Please understand you and your child’s participation is voluntary. The alternative is not to participate. Other alternatives 
  include seeking individual treatment with a current psychologist at the Pain Clinic and/or from an outside mental health provider. 
  You may also find that there is another group offered that fits your interests more at this time. If participating, <u>you have the 
  right to withdraw</u> your consent and your child’s assent or discontinue participation <u>at any time</u> without penalty or loss of 
  benefits to which you or your child is otherwise entitled. You and your child’s individual privacies will be maintained in all published 
  data resulting from the study.  
  </p>

  </p>
  <p><b>What is the purpose of this research study and how will my health information be utilized in the study?</b></p>
  <p>
  First, this study is meant to inform families about various skills and methods of coping in order to live full, healthy 
  lives despite discomfort. Second, this study may inform and enhance the quality of clinical psychotherapy treatments for 
  pediatric patients with chronic pain and their families. Collecting questionnaire information at the beginning, middle 
  and end of group therapy will help inform clinicians about work with youth with chronic discomfort regarding how and what 
  is most helpful about a group treatment that involves youth, caregiver, and family discussions. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Do I have to sign this authorization form?</b></p>
  <p>
  You do not have to sign this authorization form. But if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this research study. 
  Signing the form is not a condition for receiving any medical care outside the study.
  </p>
  <p><b>If I sign, can I revoke it or withdraw from the research later?</b></p>
  <p>
  If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your authorization regarding the use and disclosure of your health 
  information (and to discontinue any other participation in the study) at any time. After any revocation, your health 
  information will no longer be used or disclosed in the study, except to the extent that the law allows us to continue using 
  your information (e.g., necessary to maintain integrity of research). If you wish to revoke your authorization for the 
  research use or disclosure of your health information in this study, please write to: Rashmi Bhandari, Ph.D., and
