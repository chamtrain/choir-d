  <h3>Assessment of Pediatric Pain</h3>
  <p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
  You and your child are invited to participate in a research study to better understand pain conditions
  and psychosocial outcomes related to pediatric pain. You and your child will use a Stanford-encrypted iPad 
  to complete secure online questionnaires. Your responses help to inform patient care for our pediatric providers. 
  The questionnaires focus on demographics, medical history, and functioning (e.g., sleep, school, activity), as well 
  as thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the experience of pain for your child and family (e.g., stress, sadness, 
  and other pain concerns); however, at anytime, you have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. If you 
  agree to participate in the study after learning more from our research team (e.g., examples of questions, frequency 
  of questionnaires, how the study happens online, how to stop participation if wanted at any time for any reason), you 
  will be asked similar questions via email three, six, nine, 12, and 24 months after your initial visit to the Pediatric Pain Clinic.
  </p>
  <p><b>STUDY PURPOSE:</b>
  With your family’s assistance, the investigators of this project hope to develop a better understanding of medical, 
  behavioral, and psychosocial factors associated with youth with chronic pain. This is a project that may help us to 
  learn more about: 1) coping, functioning, emotions, and levels of discomfort (i.e., pain) at the time you are first 
  evaluated at LPCH/Stanford, and 2) how these areas change over time (e.g., if there is higher functioning, lower pain) 
  in the outpatient clinic, or after receiving care from the intensive rehabilitation treatment program.
  </p>
  <p><b>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</b>
  Other than needing time to complete the questionnaires, we do not anticipate any risks in this study. The questionnaires
  might make you and your child notice the way that pain has affected your lives, but we do not expect discomfort. We cannot 
  and do not guarantee or promise that your child will receive benefits from this study.
  </p>
  <p><b>WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:</b></p>
  <p>
  1. You and your child will answer questions on an iPad or on paper with pencil that will take about 45 minutes on your 
  first day in the program.  We will make sure you have time in your schedule to finish the questions. You will answer these 
  questions again when you end the program in several weeks and again in a few months.
  </p>
  <p>
  2. Your child will be asked to take some pictures with their smartphone or one of our digital cameras to explain how 
  pain has been a problem for them. Your child will be asked to take pictures of things to tell a story about their pain. 
  Your child’s pictures should not have anything that could show that it is from them, so no pictures of their face or anyone 
  else’s face, no names, no addresses, or anything that could link the pictures to your child.  We make this request in order 
  to maintain confidentiality and privacy since these pictures may be used for public viewing upon completion of the PReP program 
  at the graduation with your approval.
  </p>
  <p>
  3. You and your child will also answer questions on an iPad or on paper with pencil that will take about 15 minutes once a week.
  </p>
  <p><b>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</b></p>
  <p>
  Pediatric Rehabilitation Pain Program (PReP): if you agree to participate in this research, after your child’s graduation 
  from the rehabilitation pain program, you and your child will answer the same questions 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months after 
  completion of the program. The first time you and your child answer the questions it might take about 45 minutes, but the 
  subsequent weekly questions will only take about 15 minutes.  Once you and your child finish the program you will both be 
  asked to answer all of the questions again and that might take 30 to 45 minutes to complete online.
  </p>
  <p><b>PAYMENTS:</b>
  There is no monetary reimbursement for participation in this study.
  </p>
  <p><b>PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS:</b>
  If you have read this form and have decided to participate and to allow your child to participate in this project, please 
  understand you and your child’s participation is voluntary. The alternative is not to participate. If participating, you 
  have the right to refuse to answer particular questions and you have the right to withdraw you and your child’s consent 
  or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you or your child is otherwise 
  entitled. You and your child’s individual privacy will be maintained in all published data resulting from the study.
  </p>
  <p><b>CONTACT INFORMATION FOR QUESTIONS:</b>
  If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this research, its procedures, risks and benefits, contact the 
  Protocol Director, Dr. Anya Griffin at (650) 736-3656 or Protocol Co-Director, Dr. Amanda Feinstein at (650) 736-3494
  </p>
  <p><b>WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY:</b>
  The Protocol Director may also withdraw you and your child from the study without your consent for one or more of the following reasons:
  <ul>
  <li>Failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and study staff.</li>
  <li>The Protocol Director decides that continuing your participation could be harmful.</li>
  <li>The study is cancelled.</li>
  <li>Other administrative reasons.</li>
  <li>Unanticipated circumstances.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>AUTHORIZATION TO USE YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES (HIPAA)</h3>
  <p>
  Because information about your child’s health is personal and private, it generally cannot be used in this research study 
  without your written authorization. The form is intended to inform you about how your child’s health information will be 
  used or disclosed in the study. Your child’s information will only be used in accordance with this authorization form and 
  the informed consent form and as required or allowed by law. Please read it carefully before signing it.  
  </p>
  <p><b>What is the purpose of this research study and how will my child’s health information be utilized in the study?</b></p>
  <p>
  This study is meant to inform and enhance the quality of clinical care for pediatric patients with chronic pain. Collecting 
  information from the first PReP assessment through follow-up treatments may clarify – through a patient- and family-centered lens – the 
  Clinic’s understanding of how physical well being, family functioning, and emotional health relate to pain and other medical domains. 
  Such clarification may then help to improve established interventions for chronic pain. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Do I have to agree to be in the study?</b></p>
  <p>
  No, you do not have to agree to participate in the study. However, the questions that you and your child will answer are 
  still part of your child’s PReP treatment plan and will be used to make sure we know how well the program is helping your child. 
  If you choose to not participate in the study that is your choice, but these questions will be necessary to complete as part 
  of your child’s clinical care in PReP. Agreeing to the study is not a condition for receiving any medical care outside the study.
  </p>
  <p><b>If I agree to participate, can I revoke or withdraw from the research later?</b></p>
  <p>
  If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your authorization regarding the use and disclosure of your health 
  information (and to discontinue any other participation in the study) at any time. After any revocation, your child’s health 
  information will no longer be used or disclosed in the study, except to the extent that the law allows us to continue using 
  your information (e.g., necessary to maintain integrity of research). If you wish to revoke your authorization for the 
  research use or disclosure of your health information in this study, please write to: Anya Griffin, Ph.D. at anyag@stanford.edu.
  </p>
  <p><b>What personal information will be obtained, used or disclosed?</b></p>
  <p>
  The health information we are looking to use includes protected medical information about you and your child. We will need 
  to know you and your child’s names, in addition to his or her: medical record number, birth date, pain diagnosis and date 
  this was diagnosed. We will also need to obtain and use your phone number(s), mailing address, email address(es), and the 
  number and type of interventions your child has received for pain management (medications, physical therapy, psychotherapy, 
  occupational therapy, massage, acupuncture, etc.). We will also collect information on how your child is doing over time. 
  Information collected will include how youth are feeling and coping (pain level, stress, behaviors), and how they are 
  functioning in school, at home, with physical activity, and with friends. Similarly, we will also be asking the youth’s 
  parent to provide responses regarding observations of their child’s emotions, behaviors, and functioning at the initial 
  visit and over time. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Who may use or disclose the information?</b></p>
  <p>
  The following parties are authorized to use and/or disclose your health information in connection with this research study:
  <ul>
  <li>The Protocol Director: Anya Griffin, Ph.D.</li>

  organizations for their use in connection with this research study: 
  <ul>
  <li>The Office for Human Research Protections in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</li>
  </ul>
  Your information may be re-disclosed by the recipients described above, if they are not required by law to protect 
  the privacy of the information.
  </p>
  <p><b>When will my authorization expire?</b></p>

  <h3>Assessment of Pediatric Pain</h3>
  <p><b>1. What will happen to me in this study?</b></p>
  <p>
  We are asking you to be in a research study to understand more about kids with pain and how they deal with it. 
  Our team wants to know how pain affects what you think, how you feel, and what you do in your day-to-day life. 
  We want to improve how we evaluate (ask about) and treat (help) kids with pain by learning from you and your family.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you agree to be part of this study, we will use your responses to improve how we help kids and families like 
  yours in the future. You will also be asked to answer some of the same questions in 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months. 
  At anytime, you have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. In this study you will answer questions 
  on an iPad or on paper with pencil and take some pictures of things to explain your pain. We are happy to talk to 
  you more about what you will be doing in this study.
  </p>
  <p><b>WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:</b></p>
  <p>
  1. You and your parent will answer questions on an iPad or on paper with pencil that will take about 45 minutes on 
  your first day in the program.  We will make sure you have time in your schedule to finish the questions. You will 
  answer these questions again when you end the program in several weeks and again in a few months.  
  </p>
  <p>
  2. You will be asked to take some pictures with your smartphone or one of our digital cameras to explain how pain 
  has been a problem for you. You will be asked to take pictures of things to tell a story about your pain. Your 
  pictures should not have anything that could show that it is from you, so no pictures of your face or anyone else’s 
  face, no names, no addresses, or anything that could link the pictures to you. 
  </p>
  <p>
  3. You and your parent will also answer questions on an iPad or on paper with pencil that will take about 15 minutes once a week.  
  </p>
  <p><b>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</b></p>
  <p>
  Pediatric Rehabilitation Pain Program (PReP): if you agree to participate in this research, after your graduation 
  from the rehabilitation pain program, you will answer the same questions 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months after your 
  finish the program. The first time you answer the questions it might take about 45 minutes, but the weekly questions 
  you answer after that will only take about 15 minutes.  Once you finish the program you will answer all of the 
  questions again and that might take 30 to 45 minutes to complete online.
  </p>
  <p><b>2. Can anything bad happen to me?</b></p>
  <p>
  It is up to you to decide if you want to be part of the research study. Helping with this study will not cause anything 
  bad to happen to you. We do want you to be honest in answering the questions, and no one but us will know your answers. 
  If you do not understand some questions, or some questions make you feel worried or sad, our team will be happy to talk to you.
  </p>
  <p><b>3. Can anything good happen to me?</b></p>
  <p>
  We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive benefits from this study. However, the questions that 
  you will answer will be used to make sure we know how well the program is helping you. Being part of our study may 
  help you feel good about being involved in research for kids with chronic pain. If you agree to do this study, you 
  can tell us how you feel about your pain, and what you do about it. We will study and share what we learned from you 
  to help other kids with pain in the future, and we can share those results with you if you would like. You will help 
  to give us information that can be used to improve treatment to reduce the impact of pain on your life. 
  </p>
  <p><b>4. Do I have other choices?</b></p>
  <p>
  Of course! Your participation in this study is your choice, and you can stop being in this study at any time. The 
  other choice is not to participate, and this is okay with us and you can just answer the questions that are part 
  of your treatment in PReP. Being in the study will not affect how we take care of you at Stanford.
  </p>
  <p><b>5. Will anyone know I am in the study?</b></p>
  <p>
  Your participation in this study will be kept confidential (secret). No one but our pediatric research team will 
  know that you are participating. Even your parents will not know how you answer questions, unless you want them to, 
  or we have to tell them something to keep you healthy.
  </p>
  <p><b>6. Who can I talk to about the study?</b></p>
  <p>
  If you have any questions about the study or any problems with the study you can contact the Protocol Director, 
  Dr. Anya Griffin at (650) 736-3656. You can also call Co-Protocol Director, Dr. Amanda Feinstein at (650) 736-3494.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you have questions about the study but want to talk to someone else who is not a part of the study, you can call 
  the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB) at (650)-723-5244 or toll free at 1-866-680-2906.
  </p>
  <p><b>7. What if I do not want to do this?</b></p>
  <p>
  Your participation in this study is voluntary, meaning you can choose to be in the study or not. It is 100% up to 
  you and your parents. Even if you decide to do the study and then change your mind, that is okay. Our medical team 
  will continue to work with you and help you if you need it.
