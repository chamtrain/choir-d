  <h3>Assessment of Pediatric Pain</h3>
  <p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
  You are invited to participate in a research study to better understand pain 
  conditions and psychosocial outcomes related to pediatric pain. You and your child recently 
  completed secure online questionnaires before his/her initial appointment at the Pediatric Pain 
  Clinic at Stanford Children’s Health. If you did not have a chance to complete them before your 
  appointment, you will use a Stanford-encrypted iPad to complete the questionnaires now. Your 
  responses help to inform patient care for our pediatric providers. The questionnaires focused on 
  demographics, medical history, and functioning (e.g., sleep, school, activity), as well as 
  thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the experience of pain for your child and family 
  (e.g., stress, sadness, and other pain concerns); however, at any time, you have the right to 
  refuse to answer particular questions. If you agree to participate in the study after learning more 
  from our research team (e.g., examples of questions, frequency of questionnaires, how the study 
  happens online, how to stop participation if wanted at any time for any reason), you will be asked 
  similar questions via email three, six, nine, 12, and 24 months after your initial visit to the 
  Pediatric Pain Clinic. If you continue to receive outpatient care routinely from the Pain Clinic, 
  you may also be asked to complete a shortened version of the questionnaires every few weeks.
  </p>
  <p><b>STUDY PURPOSE:</b>
  With your family’s assistance the investigators of this project hope to develop a 
  better understanding of medical, behavioral, and psychosocial factors associated with youth with 
  chronic pain. This is a project that may help us to learn more about: 1) coping, functioning, 
  emotions, and levels of discomfort (i.e., pain) at the time you are first evaluated at 
  LPCH/Stanford, and 2) how these areas change over time (e.g., if there is higher functioning, lower 
  pain) in the outpatient clinic, or after receiving care from the intensive rehabilitation treatment 
  program.
  </p>
  <p><b>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</b>
  Other than needing time to complete the questionnaires, we do not anticipate 
  any risks in this study. The questionnaires might make you and your child notice the way that pain 
  has affected your lives, but we do not expect discomfort. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise 
  that your child will receive benefits from this study. 
  </p>
  <p><b>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</b></p>
  <p>
  Pediatric Pain Management Clinic/Outpatient Clinic (PPMC): if you choose to follow-up with your 
  child in the Pediatric Pain Management Clinic after this first visit, and agree to participate in 
  this research, you will each be asked to complete similar follow-up questionnaires in three, six, 
  nine, 12, and 24 months. Baseline questionnaires will take approximately 45 minutes online, while 
  subsequent questionnaires at the above-mentioned months will take approximately 30 minutes to 
  complete online. The shortened follow-up surveys if you receive routine outpatient care at the 
  Clinic should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.
  </p>
  <p><b>PAYMENTS:</b>
  There is no monetary reimbursement for participation in this study.
  </p>
  <p><b>PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS:</b>
  If you have read this form and have decided to participate and to allow your 
  child to participate in this project, please understand you and your child’s participation is 
  voluntary. The alternative is not to participate. If participating, you have the right to withdraw 
  you and your child’s consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of 
  benefits to which you or your child is otherwise entitled. You and your child’s individual privacy 
  will be maintained in all published data resulting from the study.  
  </p>
  <p><b>CONTACT INFORMATION FOR QUESTIONS:</b>
  If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this 
  research, its procedures, risks and benefits, contact the Protocol Director, Dr. Samantha Huestis 
  at (650) 736-3482 or Protocol Co-Director Dr. Rashmi Bhandari at (650) 724-5333.
  </p>
  <p><b>WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY:</b>
  The Protocol Director may also withdraw you and your child from the study without your consent for 
  one or more of the following reasons:
  <ul>
  <li>Failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and study staff.</li>
  <li>The Protocol Director decides that continuing your participation could be harmful.</li>
  <li>The study is cancelled.</li>
  <li>Other administrative reasons.</li>
  <li>Unanticipated circumstances.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>AUTHORIZATION TO USE YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES (HIPAA)</h3>
  <p>
  Because information about you and your health is personal and private, it generally cannot be used 
  in this research study without your written authorization. The form is intended to inform you about 
  how your health information will be used or disclosed in the study. Your information will only be 
  used in accordance with this authorization form and the informed consent form and as required or 
  allowed by law. 
  </p>
  <p><b>What is the purpose of this research study and how will my health information be utilized in the study?</b></p>
  <p>
  This study is meant to inform and enhance the quality of clinical care for pediatric patients with 
  chronic pain. Collecting information from the first Pain Clinic assessment through follow-up 
  treatments may clarify – through a patient- and family-centered lens – the Clinic’s understanding 
  of how physical wellbeing, family functioning, and emotional health relate to pain and other 
  medical domains. Such clarification may then help to improve established interventions for chronic 
  pain. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Do I have to agree to be in this study?</b></p>
  <p>
  No, you do not have to agree to participate in this study. If you do not wish to participate it is 
  your choice and will not affect the care your child receives. Agreeing to the study is not a 
  condition for receiving any medical care outside the study.
  </p>
  <p><b>If I sign, can I revoke it or withdraw from the research later?</b></p>
  <p>
  If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your authorization regarding the use and 
  disclosure of your health information (and to discontinue any other participation in the study) at 
  any time. After any revocation, your health information will no longer be used or disclosed in the 
  study, except to the extent that the law allows us to continue using your information (e.g., 
  necessary to maintain integrity of research). If you wish to revoke your authorization for the 
  research use or disclosure of your health information in this study, please write to: Rashmi 
  Bhandari, Ph.D. at rbhandar@stanford.edu.
  </p>
  <p><b>What personal information will be obtained, used or disclosed?</b></p>
  <p>
  The health information we are looking to use includes protected medical information about you and 
  your child. We will need to know you and your child’s names, in addition to his or her: medical 
  record number, birth date, pain diagnosis and date this was diagnosed. We will also need to obtain 
  and use your phone number(s), mailing address, email address(es), and the number and type of 
  interventions your child has received for pain management (medications, physical therapy, 
  psychotherapy, occupational therapy, massage, acupuncture, etc.). We will also collect information 
  on how your child is doing over time. Information collected will include how youth are feeling and 
  coping (pain level, stress, behaviors), and how they are functioning in school, at home, with 
  physical activity, and with friends. Similarly, we will also be asking the youth’s parent to 
  provide responses regarding observations of their child’s emotions, behaviors, and functioning at 
  the initial visit and over time.
