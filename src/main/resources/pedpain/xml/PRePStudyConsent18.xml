  <h3>Assessment of Pediatric Pain: Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Program</h3>
  <p><b>FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STUDY, CONTACT:</b>
  If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this research, its procedures, risks and benefits, contact 
  the Protocol Director, Dr. Anya Griffin at (650) 736-3656 or Protocol Co-Director, Dr. Amanda Feinstein at (650) 736-3494
  </p>
  <p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
  You are invited to participate in a research study to better understand pain conditions and psychosocial outcomes 
  related to pediatric pain. You will use a Stanford-encrypted iPad to complete secure online questionnaires. Your 
  responses help to inform patient care for our pediatric providers. The questionnaires focused on demographics, 
  medical history, and functioning (e.g., sleep, school, activity), as well as thoughts, feelings, and behaviors 
  related to your pain experience (e.g., stress, sadness, and other pain concerns); however, at any time, you have 
  the right to refuse to answer particular questions. If you agree to participate in the study after learning more 
  from our research team (e.g., examples of questions, frequency of questionnaires, how the study happens online, 
  how to stop participation if wanted at any time for any reason), you will be asked similar questions via email 
  three, six, nine months and one, two, three year after your initial visit to the Pediatric Pain Clinic.
  </p>
  <p><b>STUDY PURPOSE:</b>
  With your assistance, the investigators of this project hope to develop a better understanding of medical, behavioral, 
  and psychosocial factors associated with youth with chronic pain. This is a project that may help us to learn more 
  about: 1) coping, functioning, emotions, and levels of discomfort (i.e., pain) at the time you are first evaluated at 
  LPCH/Stanford, and 2) how these areas change over time (e.g., if there is higher functioning, lower pain) in the 
  outpatient clinic, or after receiving care from the intensive rehabilitation treatment program.
  </p>
  <p><b>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</b>
  Other than needing time to complete the questionnaires, we do not anticipate any risks in this study. The questionnaires 
  might make you notice the way that pain has affected your life, but we do not expect discomfort. We cannot and do not 
  guarantee or promise that you will receive benefits from this study.
  </p>
  <p><b>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</b>
  Pediatric Rehabilitation Pain Program (PReP): if you agree to participate in this research, after your graduation 
  from the rehabilitation pain program, you will answer the same questions 3, 6, 9 months and 1, 2, 3 year after 
  completion of the program. The first time you answer the questions it might take about 45 minutes, but the subsequent 
  weekly questions will only take about 15 minutes.  Once you finish the program you will be asked to answer all of 
  the questions again and that might take 30 to 45 minutes to complete online.
  </p>
  <p><b>WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:</b></p>
  <p>
  1. You will answer questions on an iPad or on paper with pencil that will take about 45 minutes on your first day in 
  the program.  We will make sure you have time in your schedule to finish the questions. You will answer these questions 
  again when you end the program in several weeks and again in a few months.
  </p>
  <p>
  2. You will be asked to take some pictures with your smartphone or one of our digital cameras to explain how pain has 
  been a problem for you. You will be asked to take pictures of things to tell a story about your pain. Your pictures 
  should not have anything that could show that it is from you, so no pictures of you face or anyone else’s face, no names, 
  no addresses, or anything that could link the pictures to you.  We make this request in order to maintain confidentiality 
  and privacy since these pictures may be used for public viewing upon completion of the PReP program at the graduation 
  with your approval.  
  </p>
  <p>
  3. You will also answer questions on an iPad or on paper with pencil that will take about 15 minutes once a week.
  </p>
  <p><b>PAYMENTS:</b>
  There is no monetary reimbursement for participation in this study.
  </p>

  have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which 
  you are otherwise entitled. Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published data resulting from the study.
  </p>

  <h3>AUTHORIZATION TO USE YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES (HIPAA)</h3>
  <p>
  Because information about your health is personal and private, it generally cannot be used in this research study without 
  your written authorization. This form is intended to inform you about how your health information will be used or disclosed 
  in the study. Your information will only be used in accordance with this authorization form and the informed consent form 
  and as required or allowed by law. Please read it carefully before signing it.  
  </p>
  <p><b>What is the purpose of this research study and how will my child’s health information be utilized in the study?</b></p>
  <p>
  This study is meant to inform and enhance the quality of clinical care for the pediatric and adult population over 18 year old 
  with chronic pain. Collecting information from the first PReP assessment through follow-up treatments may clarify – through a 
  patient- and family-centered lens – the Clinic’s understanding of how physical well being, family functioning, and emotional 
  health relate to pain and other medical domains. Such clarification may then help to improve established interventions for 
  chronic pain. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Do I have to sign this authorization form?</b></p>
  <p>
  No, you do not have to sign to participate in the study. However, the questions that you will answer are still part of your 
  PReP treatment plan and will be used to make sure we know how well the program is helping you. If you choose to not participate 
  in the study that is your choice, but these questions will be necessary to complete as part of your clinical care in PReP. 
  You do not have to sign this authorization form.  But if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this research study. 
  Signing this form is not a condition for receiving any medical care outside the study.
  </p>
  <p><b>If I sign to participate, can I revoke or withdraw from the research later?</b></p>
  <p>
  If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your authorization regarding the use and disclosure of your health 
  information (and to discontinue any other participation in the study) at any time. After any revocation, your health information 
  will no longer be used or disclosed in the study, except to the extent that the law allows us to continue using your information 
  (e.g., necessary to maintain integrity of research). If you wish to revoke your authorization for the research use or disclosure 
  of your health information in this study, please write to: Anya Griffin, Ph.D. at 321 Middlefield Rd., Suite 225, 
  Menlo Park, CA, 94025. She may also be reached via email at anyag@stanford.edu.
  </p>
  <p><b>What personal information will be obtained, used or disclosed?</b></p>
  <p>
  The health information we are looking to use includes protected medical information about you. We will need to know your name, 
  in addition to your: medical record number, birth date, pain diagnosis and date this was diagnosed. We will also need to obtain 
  and use your phone number(s), mailing address, email address(es), and the number and type of interventions you have received 
  for pain management (medications, physical therapy, psychotherapy, occupational therapy, massage, acupuncture, etc.). We will 
  also be collecting a photo at the beginning and end of your treatment. We will also collect information on how you are doing 
  over time. Information collected will include how youth are feeling and coping (pain level, stress, behaviors), and how they 
  are functioning in school, at home, with physical activity, and with friends.
