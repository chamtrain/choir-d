      <Description><![CDATA[<p>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH</p>
    <p>You are invited to participate in a research study of whether measuring patient symptoms and outcomes over time
        is
        feasible in our department. We hope to learn about barriers to collecting measures, so that we can address them
        and
        ultimately improve care. Additionally, the findings will inform the scientific literature for development and
        dissemination of measurement based care across the field of Psychiatry. We also would like to analyze the data
        to
        help build a model that may inform treatment decision making in the future. You were selected as a possible
        participant in this study because you are coming to Stanford Department of Psychiatry for care in one of the
        participating clinics.</p>
    <p>If you decide to terminate your participation in this study, you should notify Sarah Adler, Psy.D. at
        650-468-0771
    </p>
    <p>This research study is looking for 750-1250 people who are presenting for care in the Department of Psychiatry.
    </p>

    <p>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION</p>
    <p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. Your decision not to participate will not have any
        negative
        effect on you or your medical care. You can decide to participate now, but withdraw your consent later and stop
        being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical care to which you are entitled.</p>

    <p>DURATION OF STUDY INVOLVEMENT</p>
    <p>This research study is expected to take approximately 1 year, with 6 months of participation by each participant.
        Participation means collecting measures on symptoms as a part of standard treatment</p>

    <p>PROCEDURES</p>
    <p>If you choose to participate, Sarah Adler, PsyD and her research study staff will ask you to sign this consent
        and
        give us permission to track your data through standard assessments that will be administered as part of your
        care.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The purpose of this study is to see if collecting these measures in a systematic way is feasible, to assess
            for
            potential barriers and ultimately to use this information to standardize measurement based care across the
            department.</li>
        <li>You will fill out measures each time you come to an appointment at the Department of Psychiatry.</li>
        <li>If you elect to be in the study, we will ask you to fill out a satisfaction survey about your experience
            filling
            out the standard assessments. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>PARTICIPANT RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
    <p>As a participant, your responsibilities include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask questions as you think of them.</li>
        <li>Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you change your mind about staying in the study.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY</p>
    <p>If you first agree to participate and then you change your mind, you are free to withdraw your consent and
        discontinue your participation at any time. Your decision will not affect your ability to receive medical care
        for
        your disease and you will not lose any benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled. If you decide to
        withdraw
        your consent to participate in this study, you should notify Sarah Adler, PsyD at 650-468-0771.</p>

    <p>POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES</p>
    <p>There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. These deserve careful
        thought.
        You should talk with the Protocol Director if you have any questions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assessments about psychological symptoms can be distressing. Whether you fill out the assessments that are
            provided is up to you and your provider.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>POTENTIAL BENEFITS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Filling out assessments can give your provider important information that they may not otherwise have. This
            could potentially improve your treatment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.</p>
    <p>ALTERNATIVES</p>
    <p>There are no real alternatives to this study other than choosing not to participate. You will receive that same
        standard of care regardless of your participation.</p>

    <p>PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS</p>
    <p>You should not feel obligated to agree to participate. Your questions should be answered clearly and to your
        satisfaction. If you decide not to participate, tell the Protocol Director. You will be told of any important
        new
        information that is learned during the course of this research study, which might affect your condition or your
        willingness to continue participation in this study. </p>
