  <p><b>CONSENT FORM</b></p>
  <p><b>Patient Outcomes in Interventional Radiology</b></p>
  <p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b> You are invited to participate in an ongoing collection of clinical
  information that will be used to track your progress in our clinic. The health information
  we collect could also be used to find future areas for research investigation. Information
  on your clinical progress is collected during your routine visits to the Stanford Interventional
  Radiology Clinic. This study is being performed to understand the patient outcomes of different
  types of interventional radiology procedures.
  </p>
  <p><b>PROCEDURES:</b> With your permission, we would like to collect information from a
  variety of sources that we use in your routine clinical care.  These include self-report
  questionnaires and data stored in your electronic health record. This information is placed
  into a secure, encrypted and password protected database system at Stanford. This database
  will be used to track your progress and could also be used to view outcomes after your
  chosen treatment. Then, after your chosen treatment, you may receive email contact from
  the clinic asking how you are feeling.  You may opt-out of these emails at any time, or
  choose not to receive them at all.
  </p>
  <p><b>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</b> There are no risks to participants in this study. The benefits,
  which may reasonably be expected to result from this study, are better tracking of progress
  by your physician. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits
  from this study.
  </p>
  <p><b>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</b> Your participation in this study will not require more time from
  you other than for the initial visit where this study is explained to you and under 5 minutes
  to complete the clinical questionnaires. If you agree to participate, we will collect your medical
  information from your medical record after each visit, which does not involve any direct
  participation by you.
  </p>
  <p><b>PAYMENTS:</b> You will not be paid to participate in this study.
  </p> 
  <p><b>PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS:</b> If you have read this form and have decided to participate in
  this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw
  your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to

  The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or
  published in scientific journals. However, your identity will not be disclosed.
  </p>
  <p><b>Authorization to Use Your Health Information for Research Purposes</b></p>

  choose to participate, information from self-report questionnaires and the electronic medical record
  will be recorded in a secure database system. This database will be used to track your progress
  and determine outcomes from treatments. There is no study intervention involved and no change in
  your routine treatment. If you participate, you will be asked to complete routine questionnaires
  via electronic survey, either on your home computer before your appointment or on a tablet in the
  reception area or exam room while waiting for the appointment.
