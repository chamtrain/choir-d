Subject: Stanford ME/CFS Clinic Patient Questionnaire

Hello. This is a friendly reminder that we would like you to please complete a new questionnaire for the Stanford ME/CFS Clinic. You can access the questionnaire by clicking on the following link:
[SURVEY_LINK]  

This link will be valid through  [SURVEY_DATE] only. 

Note you may receive this request even if you do not have an upcoming appointment because we are tracking your health over the long term.  This information helps us to help you as well as other patients living with ME/CFS.  If you begin the questionnaire and are unable to finish you can return to where you left off using the same link.

If you have any questions or have any troubles accessing the questionnaire via the link please give us a call at 650-723-9711.

Thank you,
The Stanford ME/CFS Team
