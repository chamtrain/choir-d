Subject: Stanford ME/CFS Clinic Patient Questionnaire

Hello. We would like you to please complete a new questionnaire for your appointment at the Stanford ME/CFS Clinic. Please take the online survey by [SURVEY_DATE]. You can do this by clicking on the following link:
[SURVEY_LINK]  

If you have any questions or have any troubles accessing the questionnaire via the link please give us a call at 650-723-9711.  

If you are not able to complete the online questionnaire prior to  [SURVEY_DATE] then please arrive 10-15 minutes early when you visit in person in order to ensure you have enough time to complete the questionnaire at the clinic before your scheduled appointment.

Thank you,
The Stanford ME/CFS Team
