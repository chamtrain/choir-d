        <![CDATA[<p><b>You are almost done</b><p>The following questions will help us to assess your general physical, psychological and social health.
        Our research at Stanford has shown that each personâ€™s unique health status impacts how they will respond to and recover from surgery.
        Furthermore, at Stanford we are committed to treating you as a whole person, and not just the part of you undergoing surgery or a procedure.
        We do not use this information to diagnose any conditions. Rather we want to obtain a general sense of your overall health to determine how to best help you.
        Please feel free to ask your clinician about any of this information.
        We thank you for the time in filling out the following questions.</p>]]>
