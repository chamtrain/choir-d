                <![CDATA[We are interested in learning more about how you are feeling after your procedure at Stanford. We would like to contact you with a much briefer version of this survey which will assess your overall health. Note you may receive this request even if you donâ€™t have an upcoming appointment because we are tracking your health over the long term. We will use this information to provide the best care possible for you and other patients like you.
                 <p>May we contact you?]]>
